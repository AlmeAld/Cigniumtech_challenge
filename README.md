### Proposal

The project was about to build a landing page, which was one page. So basically, my best option would be using simple HTML, CSS and JS without libraries. 
Since I want to improve performance and we dont't need much things like bootstrap or foundation, I start using Scss which would be the right choice to create nested classes and start using BEM(Block-Element-Modifiers) architecture for handling naming classes.

Plus, I decided working with toolings like webpack since I have some background on it, and it makes our CSS, JS minify, and you have all control to configure the way you want to work. 

Finally, I would've tried parcel as a tooling since it would be faster than setting webpack. To be honest, I prefer using webpack in bigger projects but since I have a boilerplate to work with React, SASS and HTML, I decided to use that one. 
On the other hand,  I've recently been working with Gatsby to make Landing Pages. It would be another good option to make this project.

Thanks for the opportunity!
